Scrape the news

When you start the app the homepage will display

 ![see home page ](/public/images/home.gif "scrape app")

 click on the scrape ![new scrape ](/public/images/scrape.gif "scrape app") NEW Articles button

The news headlines are saved into the database. A modal display is supposed to display but I did not get it to work

click on saved articles button ![saved ](/public/images/saved.gif "scrape app") to display all saved articles.

you can delete an article or add a comment. click on the relevent button for the action.

the app displays the below.
![saved ](/public/images/addComment.gif "scrape app")

enter your name and comment. click Save Note. the comment window will close.

to delete a comment, click on the add comment button to display the comment window then click Delete Note.

to delete an article, click the delete Article button.

when an article is deleted, the page does not refresh and therefore makes a user think the article is not delete when actually it has been deleted. I will work on this later.

Happy scraping.
